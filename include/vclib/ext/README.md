# External Libraries

This folder contains a set of VCLib functions and classes that can be used only if you have the corresponding external library available on your system.

The functionalities are then accessible under a specific namespace for each library.

A list of the supported libraries, their paths and their namespaces is provided below:

| Library(s) | Namespace | Path | Notes |
|:----------:|:---------:|:----:|:-----:|
| [VCG](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/) | `vcl::vc` | `ext/vcg` | |
