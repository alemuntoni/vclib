# VCLib benchmarks

Run the following commands from the repository root to build the Release mesh
benchmark executable:

```sh
cmake --preset vclib-core-benchmarks
cmake --build out/build/vclib-core-benchmarks --target vclib-core-benchmark-mesh
```

## Selecting a mesh type

Use `--mesh-type` to choose the representation at runtime:

```sh
out/build/vclib-core-benchmarks/benchmarks/core/mesh/vclib-core-benchmark-mesh \
    --mesh-type trimesh64 --grid 1000 1000 --json report.json
```

| CLI name (v2) | C++ type | Scalar | Reference representation |
|---------------|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| `trimesh` (default) | `vcl::TriMesh` | double | 32-bit indices |
| `trimeshf` | `vcl::TriMeshf` | float | 32-bit indices |
| `trimesh64` | `vcl::TriMesh64` | double | 64-bit indices |
| `trimesh64f` | `vcl::TriMesh64f` | float | 64-bit indices |

The same option applies when passing a mesh file instead of `--grid`.
All four types are compiled into one executable; selection happens outside the
measured operations. An unsupported mesh type is an error.

The `--config` JSON file also accepts a `mesh_type` key:

```json
{
    "mesh_type": "trimesh64",
    "grid": [1000, 1000],
    "include": ["stat/*"],
    "iterations": 10
}
```

The command line overrides the configuration; without either, `trimesh` is used.
The selected type is printed and saved in the report's `metadata.mesh_type`.
Reports identify `version` as `v2` and include `mesh_generation`, `scalar_type`,
`scalar_bits`, `reference_kind`, and `reference_bits` in their metadata.
Widths are measured from the C++ types, not inferred from their CLI names.
Use `--help` for all options and `--list` to inspect the selected benchmarks
without loading a dataset.

During the v2 port, not all IO formats and algorithms are available. Use OBJ or
PLY for file datasets, or a generated grid. Empty datasets are rejected rather
than producing misleading measurements; unported import/export benchmarks remain
disabled in the target's CMake source list.

## Adding benchmarks

The [mesh benchmarks](core/mesh) follow the library's algorithm groups.
Register a generic lambda with `BENCH`, or `BENCH_SLOW` for a benchmark excluded
by default:

```cpp
BENCH("stat/bounding_box/bounding_box",
    []<typename Mesh>(bench::State<Mesh>& s) {
        const Mesh& m = s.mesh();
        s.run([&]() { return vcl::boundingBox(m); });
    });
```

[State and Context](core/mesh/benchmark.h) are templated on the mesh type.
Registration instantiates each benchmark for every type listed in
[types.h](core/mesh/types.h). Keep helpers generic too, and use `s.skip(reason)`
when a dataset does not satisfy a benchmark's requirements.

See the [comparison scripts](../scripts/benchmarks/README.md) for comparing
reports, binaries, or branches and running regression tests.
