========================
Visual Computing Library
========================

This is a C++20 modern and header only Mesh and Geometry Processing templated library.

The goal of this library is to provide a set of tools and algorithms in a well-structured Object Oriented paradigm exploiting the powerfullness of C++20.

To get started, you can either add the ``vclib/include`` directory into your ``INCLUDE_PATH`` (depending on your operative system), or
you can add the libary path as subdirectory in your ``cmake`` project, and link the ``vclib`` target.
