Mesh Customization
==================

Customize an Element
--------------------

Let's for example define our customized Vertex Element, that we are going to call ``MyVertex``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <vclib/mesh/mesh.h>

   class MyVertex :
       public vcl::Vertex<
           vcl::vert::BitFlags,
           vcl::vert::Coordinate3f,
           vcl::vert::Normal3f,
           vcl::vert::Color,
           vcl::vert::Scalard>
   {};

We defined a Vertex Element that has several components: `BitFlags` (flags are mandatory for each Element),
a 3D float coordinate, a 3D float normal, a color and a double-type scalar. The class MyVertex will be then
composed of all the public member functions that are provided by its components. You can find the list of
all the components that can be used to create a Vertex provided by VCLib on :ref:`this page<vertex>`, and you
can also create your own custom component class and add it in the list of components in your Vertex definition.
You can add components as many as you want in your Element definition.

Customize a Mesh
----------------

Now let's define our custom Point Cloud Mesh, that we are going to call ``MyPointCloud``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class MyPointCloud :
       public vcl::Mesh<
           vcl::mesh::VertexContainer<MyVertex>,
           vcl::mesh::BoundingBox3d,
           vcl::mesh::TransformMatrix>
   {};

The template types of the Mesh are treated as Components, in the same way of the Vertex Components in ``MyVertex`` class.
Therefore, the Mesh type ``MyPointCloud`` will be composed of a :ref:`vertex_container` of the previous defined ``MyVertex``
type, plus a bounding box and a transform matrix.
