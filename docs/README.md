# mgplib documentation

Documentation is automatically generated by CMake when option `MGP_BUILD_DOCS` is set to on.

The automatic build system is inspired by [this tutorial](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/).

Requirements:

 - Doxygen (`sudo apt install doxygen`)
 - sphinx (`pip3 install sphinx`)
 - breathe (`pip3 install breathe`)
 - read the docs theme (`pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme`)
