# VCLib ToDo list

- Mesh:
  - Concepts:
    - [ ] complete space data structures concepts
    - [ ] implement per edge concepts
  - Components:
    - [ ] add a static boolean that allows to discriminate components that are tied to vertex number when used in faces
    - [ ] add FaceEdgeBitFlag component
    - [ ] add an enum COMPONENT_TYPE that allows to identify same class of components easily -- same usage of ELEMENT_TYPE for elements
      - [ ] then allow to write a generic enableSameOptionalComponentsOf member function in ElementContainer
  - Elements:
    - [ ] set properly elements concepts
    - [ ] set constructors for Edge element
    - [ ] set constructors for HalfEdge element
  - Containers:
    - [ ] set properly container concepts
  - Iterators:
    - [ ] all iterators of the library must satisfy at least std::forward_iterator concept (also half edge ones)
    - [ ] implement range iterators for element scalars and colors
  - Mesh:
    - [ ] manage clean() for all components of mesh, not only element containers
    - [ ] import dcel from mesh: update adjacent faces and wedges 
- Algorithms:
  - [ ] take iterator arguments instead of vectors (e.g. for selection) - allows to be more general on algorithms
  - [ ] intersection functions (like distance functions)
  - Point Sampling:
    - [ ] uniform all the function, that should take an out argument of birthVertices/birthFaces
    - [ ] weights input argument of all the function should be a range
    - [ ] implement housdorff
  - [ ] update adjacent faces optimized for dcel
- Space:
  - [ ] move algorithm/polygon/geometry functions into two space data structure Triangle and Polygon.
    - [ ] remove the usage of the old functions
    - [ ] make the Triangle and Polygon concepts, making sure that Triangle satisfies PolygonConcept
  - [ ] implement ArrayConcept that works also with Eigen matrices in 2D (see export_to_matrix in algorithms)
  - [ ] move random access container in space. In general, every data structure must be in space directory
- External:
  - [ ] make render functions using bgfx
- Documentation:
  - [ ] Make documentation using only doxygen
  - [ ] Explain appropriately the structure of the library
- Style:
  - [ ] Each directory must be at singular, not plural (i.e. container, not containers)
