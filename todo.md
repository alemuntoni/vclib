# VCLib ToDo list

- Mesh:
  - Concepts:
    - [ ] complete space data structures concepts
    - [ ] implement per edge concepts
  - Components:
    - [ ] add a static boolean that allows to discriminate components that are tied to vertex number when used in faces
    - [ ] add FaceEdgeBitFlag component - a bit flag for each edge of the face (tied with number of vertices or, in case of dcel, stored in half edge)
      - [ ] needs to be interchangeable with TriangleBitFlags and PolygonBitFlags
    - [ ] add an enum COMPONENT_TYPE that allows to identify same class of components easily -- same usage of ELEMENT_TYPE for elements
      - [ ] then allow to write a generic enableSameOptionalComponentsOf member function in ElementContainer
  - Elements:
    - [ ] set properly elements concepts
    - [ ] set constructors for Edge element
    - [ ] set constructors for HalfEdge element
  - Containers:
    - [ ] set properly container concepts
  - Mesh:
    - [ ] manage clean() for all components of mesh, not only element containers
    - [ ] import dcel from mesh: update adjacent faces and wedges 
- Algorithms:
  - [ ] take views arguments instead of vectors (e.g. for selection) - allows to be more general on algorithms
  - [ ] intersection functions (like distance functions)
  - Point Sampling:
    - [ ] uniform all the function, that should take an out argument of birthVertices/birthFaces
    - [ ] weights input argument of all the function should be a range
  - [ ] update adjacent faces optimized for dcel
- Space:
  - [ ] implement ArrayConcept that works also with Eigen matrices in 2D (see export_to_matrix in algorithms)
  - [ ] move random access container in space. In general, every data structure must be in space directory
- External:
  - [ ] make render functions using bgfx
- Documentation:
  - [ ] Make documentation using only doxygen
  - [ ] Explain appropriately the structure of the library
